        <h4 id="names">Ina</h4>
        <p>My name is Ina and I am 17 years old. I love pole vault and rock climbing. Also solar panels and electric cars interest me. ECOde is a project that I helped develop and my focus was on creating a bus tracker for the public buses in Chicago in order to generate more interest in reducing pollution.

        <h4 id="names">Bridget</h4>
        <p>Hi! I'm Bridget. I enjoyed working on ECOde because I enjoy the outdoors and want to help preserve it for future generations to enjoy also.  Any free time I have I try to go hiking, walking, or swimming. I helped develop the HTML for multiple tabs and CSS for the Effects On Animals tab. </p>

        <p>Hi! My name is Bea and I am 16 years old from Merida, Venezuela. I currently live in Houston, Texas, play varsity tennis and enjoy learning about the world around me. I am interested in the stem field and global affairs. As a group we were motivated to make a website with an impact and were inspired by the current movement encouraging ecologically responsible citizens. During the development of ECOde I focused on the styling, and structure of the webpage.  </p>

        <h4 id="names">Emerald</h4>
        <p> I’m Emerald Arteaga, a rising Senior from Austin Texas. Since the beginning of my education I have been taught ways on how to ‘save our world’ either by recycling, not polluting, and being conscious of other animals that live among us. However, much of this can be forgotten or not made of importance to many. So I hope that our website is able to provide the importance of the dangers and the effects of us not taking proper care of Earth can cause. It is our one and only home, lets try to protect it!</p>
